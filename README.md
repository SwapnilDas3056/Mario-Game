# Mario-Runner-Game

### About:
This game is a infinite runner game created by me, Swapnil Das, an amateur programmer. In this game, you will play as mario, collecting coins and dodging obstacles.

### How to play:
Click on the start button to begin playing the game. Use the spacebar to jump and left and right arrow keys to move.
At the beginning, mario will be placed on a platform. This platform will disappear after a while, and you will have to jump to avoid falling down.

Now, new platforms with doors, or "windows" will appear periodically, and you will have to go on top of them to stay safe.
Ladders will help you climb and easily reach the platform, but beware of the spikes that might appear under some of the platforms.

There will be a coin on top of each platform, you will have to collect it by making mario touch the coin.
This will increase your score indicated by the 'Coins Collected' text on the bottom left.

Other than the spikes, there is another obstacle which will also appear after playing the game for a while. It is a green pipe which will appear at either the left or ride edge of the screen.
The pipe will shoot a bullet which you will have to dodge. Avoid touching the pipe or the bullet.

The game will be over if mario falls off the bottom edge of the screen, or if mario touches any of the obstacles (spikes, pipe, bullets). Click on the replay button that will appear on the game over screen to play the game again.

### Controls:
Spacebar - to jump

Left and right arrow key - to move mario

#### This game can only be played on laptop, or desktop, where keyboard is available. It is not supported on mobile or tablet.

### Updates:
1.1 - I added a scoring system. Collect the coins to increase your score.

1.2 - Final score can now be viewed in the game over screen. New high score mechanic added. High score can be viewed only at the game over screen.

Small bug fix - Fixed the collider radius of the pipe so that the game will be over only if mario exactly touches the edge of the pipe. Previously, the collider was too big and the game got over before mario could visibly touch the pipe.
